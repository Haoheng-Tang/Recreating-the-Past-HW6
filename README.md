# Recreating-the-Past-HW6

I am fascinated with one of Jason Salavon’s works which depicts the looks of homes for sale in different cities, so I drew this group of pictures using hundreds of photos acquired through Google. Each image is actually an “average” of a hundred of photos of homes for sale in a city. The height of the houses in different cities are almost the same. However, it is easy to find out the differences between places. Images of houses in Minneapolis mostly contain snows. Images of houses in Houston, Murfreesboro and Washington D.C. contain larger area of greens than others. The houses in Murfreesboro, especially, are surrounded by large area of grass. The “average” looks of homes for sale in different cities show the distinct landscapes and climates throughout the country.
